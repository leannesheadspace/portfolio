  <h2> My masterpieces  </h2>
  <h3> "Escape"</h3>
  <img src="visual design media/My project-1.png" width="425" height="550" alt=""/> 
  <p> Purple and pink are my favorite colors and that’s why it’s the dominant palette in this piece. These are my favorite tv shows which are animated because as a kid I didn’t get the chance to watch many cartoons so I use that time now to make that up. Astrology is also a passion of mine and that’s why there’s an astronomical element to the work.</p>
  <h3> "Fawn" </h3>
    <img src="visual design media/pixel character.png" width="200" height="200" alt=""/>
  <p> I’ve always loved fantasy, the ability to immerse myself in another dimension gave me hope whenever I was down. Unfortunately, in these stories and games that I’ve connected with there was still the distance between the characters and how they never looked like me. I want to be a creator but that doesn’t mean diminishing important aspects of the world, myself, and my communities. A dystopian world based on the oppression of my people will never understand the real power struggle. That being said, that is not what it is all about, black girls should always have the opportunity to see themselves as a hero and not a side character. Fawn is an elf in a forest and is on the way to save the wilting flowers and the muddy waters of their home. In order to do so, they will use the help of what’s been around them since the beginning, nature. The flora and fauna will lead the way for them, as long as their heart is in the right place. </p>  
  <h3> "Inkblot"</h3>
    <img src="visual design media/projectttfunn.png" width="296.6" height="296.6" alt=""/> 
  <p> This project was very different from what I’ve made because it’s not pretty. And I like making pretty
things so that was hard for me but it was actually kind of fun and refreshing not having to worry
about the way others perceive the image because I know that everyone’s work would turn out
unrecognizable. I chose lavenders for the original image because they’re my favorite flower and I
found the process to be easy. </p>
	  <h3> "Wheat Field"</h3>
    <img src="visual design media/mandalaa.png" width="435" height="435" alt="mandala project"/>
  <p>I didn’t think I would like the way this project ended up but I actually loved the end result. I think it
looks like wheat/barley on a summer day. I also like how it resembles a sun because I think the sun
design is so pretty. The process was repetitive of just duplicating layers but it was fun, I was relieved
that I subconsciously made it even just by lining each layer up in the middle. </p>
	  <h3> "Yasmin"</h3>
    <img src="visual design media/yasmin-web.png" width="500" height="500" alt=""/>
    <p>My Pop Art Celebrity is Yasmin Benoit who is a black aromantic asexual activist. I love her so
much because of the fact that a black woman became the face of a movement and that means
the entire world to me. I really loved the way purple and orange came together in the piece. I
wanted to do pink/blue but then I saw that was a popular color palette in the classroom so I
added other colors to make it pop and I really love the outcome. I also think purple is Yasmin’s
color as an predominant asexual activist.</p>
